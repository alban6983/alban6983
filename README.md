Hi, I’m @alban6983
Inovation in tech is my favorite field (Blockchains, AI, ...)
I've built several applications, from specs to sales and support, since 20 years (e.g. opendial, an IPBX based on asterisk, or TransEdoc, a eCMR progressive WebApp).
About dev, I have good knowledge in PHP, SQL, and some in vue.js. I used also java, C++, angular, bash...
